# LinkerMind: An Interpretable, Mechanism-Informed Deep Learning Framework for ADC Linker Design

## Overview
LinkerMind is a comprehensive computational platform for the *de novo* design of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) linkers. This framework integrates mechanistic chemical intelligence with deep learning to generate novel, optimized linker candidates.

## Features
- **Multi-modal deep learning** combining structural fingerprints with mechanistic descriptors
- **Generative AI pipeline** for *de novo* linker design
- **Scaffold-split validation** for rigorous performance evaluation
- **Mechanism-informed features** capturing cleavable motifs
- **Multi-objective optimization** for balanced linker properties

## Installation

### Using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
